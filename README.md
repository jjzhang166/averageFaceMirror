# average face mirror

computes the average of the faces it detects (from the webcam feed)

- of 0.8.4
- based on kyle mcdonald's [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
- you'll need to download ofxFaceTracker and put it in your openframeworks addons/ folder, and then copy this directory in your ofxFaceTracker/ directory.


## to do:
- ~~right now it's anchored on the eyes -> add fixed mouth pos~~
- ~~make sure it can run for several hours...!~~
- ~~add debug mode vs presentation mode~~
  - ~~display webcam feed~~
  - ~~display # of used images~~
  - display past images
- ~~change to portrait mode instead of landscape~~
- ~~(maybe add keystone correction for projection..?)~~
- ~~add minimum face size~~
- debugging + optimization.
