# average face mirror

computes the average of the faces it detects (from the webcam feed)

- of 0.8.4
- based on kyle mcdonald's [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
- you'll need to download ofxFaceTracker and put it in your openframeworks addons/ folder, and then copy this directory in your ofxFaceTracker/ directory.


## to do:
- add minimum face size
- right now it's anchored on the eyes -> add fixed mouth pos
- add debug mode vs presentation mode
  - display webcam feed
  - display # of used images
  - display past images
- change to portrait mode instead of landscape
- (maybe add keystone correction for projection..?)
- debugging + optimization.
- make sure it can run for several hours...
